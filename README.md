# E-commerce Demo

This is a small demo project scaffolder created by create_ecommerce_frontend_structure.py.

How to use:

1. Run the python script to create the folder `ecommerce-demo`.
2. `cd ecommerce-demo` then `npm install` (this will install express).
3. `npm start` and open http://localhost:3000

Edit files in `public/` to customize the frontend. The server exposes `/api/products` which serves `data/products.json`.
